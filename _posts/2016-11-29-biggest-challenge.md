title: The biggest challenge you've faced when learning to develop
---

I feel the web development is very hard, fun, and interesting.

##Hard:
 - Need to be very careful, because application can has error and be crushed if I make any mistake, even I only misspell one letter.
 - When there's a mistake, need to review code, find out mistake, and fix it.
 - There're a lot of information, tool, and language about coding. Every time when I create a new application, I need to learn how to use new tool.
 

##Fun and interesting
 - It's very fun to learn new tools, gems, languages.
 - I will feel excited everytime when I know how to use new tools, and find out which part of codes cause the error and crushed.
 - There're a lot of informations and tools for different coding languages. Every time when I use new tools, I have chance to find out how to use them and to improve my coding skill.
